# week-3-game Hangman Style Game

Here's a [link](http://week-3-game.herokuapp.com/) to the live demo.

### Objectives
1. choose a theme for your game. 
  * In the example, we used an 80s theme. All the words are famous bands or musicians from the 80s. Please choose whatever theme you'd like.

3. use key events to get the letter that the user typed

4. organize your game code inside of an object, except the key events to get the letter that the user typed.

5. Display the following on the page:

	Press any key to get started!

	Wins: # of times user guessed the word correctly

	If the word is madonna then display it initially like this:
	_ _ _ _ _ _ _

	as the user guesses the correct letter, make the word display like this:
	mado _  _ a

	Number of Guesses Remaining: # of guesses remaining for the user

	Letters Already Guessed: letters the user has guessed.

5. The game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.

##### Hangman Game Bonuses

1. Play a sound or song when the user guesses the word correctly - in our case it was a song by the artist

2. Style your game so that it looks like your theme.
